Uhhmm... i'm just a casual gamer who likes to create levels.
Some level editors require scripting, so i was forced to learn the basics of logic.
And here I am, planning to make a Super Tux addon :v

(gosh I have no idea how to use github, i can't even break a line in this .md file and everyone will see the mistakes I made here, what a shame)
